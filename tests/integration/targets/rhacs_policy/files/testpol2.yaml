  description: >
    Alert when binaries used to compile software are executed at runtime
  rationale: >
    Use of compilation tools during runtime indicates that new software may be
    being introduced into containers while they are running.
  remediation: >
    Compile all necessary application code during the image build process.
    Avoid packaging software build tools in container images. Use your
    distribution's package manager to remove compilers and other build tools
    from images.
